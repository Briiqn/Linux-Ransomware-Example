# Linux-Ransomware-Example
python3 easygui *FAKE* installer with a script which can store files in a zip archive with a random password everytime

this is for educational purposes

i havent removed the folder that shows the password for debugging purposes


This so far only "encrypts" the files in the directory of the scripts

Only try this on a virtual machine that you dont care about as im not responsible for any damage done to your device


Dependencies 
Python3
easygui: pip install easygui

Any Linux Distrobution with bash/sh/zsh (idk if any linux distros dont have this but still gonna mention it)

To do


ping a test server the password via bytes of data  & remove the test password folder
